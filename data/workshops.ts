    abstract: `Meet the AHA stack, combining Astro, htmx, and Alpine.js to deliver rich, interactive sites in a surprisingly easy way. Alpine is a small component-based library with a Vue-like declarative syntax that integrates simply into HTML, while htmx is a superset of HTML designed specifically for fetching partials from the backend and swapping them on the UI as a response to HTTP requests. Both of them can be quickly dropped into any site using a <script> tag, forgoing the need for complex build systems, while they both can be explained by their commendably short documentation. Still, together they provide the same expressiveness and look for 90% of use cases as Next does. The site's template and the partials are served by Astro, the only server-side rendering JS solution on the market that you can get started with without feeling you're learning a completely new trade. Join us in exploring these tools if you also feel it's time to take a step back and see how we can simplify our lives without forfeiting the ability to create modern Single-Page Applications, using the techniques we got used to.`,
