        In this talk I will be deep-diving into the world of Web Crypto APIs, starting from key generation, various encryption algorithms, implementation techniques, and more. The session will include live demos, coding examples, and a fun side project that I created as a result of learning about the Web Crypto APIs. Let’s set out on a collaborative learning adventure and delve into the functionalities of Web Crypto APIs.`,

      abstract: `If you've been building websites for a while you ""know"" that some things require JS and that's just the way it is. Turns out, spec writers and browser makers both are working hard to find common JS patterns and implementing them in CSS and HTML. Things like accordions, auto-suggest, smooth scrolling, dialogs are all available without JS. Looking a little ahead, things like parallax scrolling, styleable selects and component-dependent styling are expected to make their CSS-debut as well.

In this talk I go through common patterns, explain how they can be implemented in CSS and HTML, how that's better and what accessibility implications they have, both for features available today and feature available soon™️.`,
