        How do Web Crypto APIs differ from the Crypto module in Node.js?

        In this talk I will be deep-diving into the world of Web Crypto APIs, starting from key generation, various encryption algorithms, implementation techniques, and more. The session will include live demos, coding examples, and a fun side project that I created as a result of learning about the Web Crypto APIs. Let’s set out on a collaborative learning adventure and delve into the functionalities of Web Crypto APIs.`,
