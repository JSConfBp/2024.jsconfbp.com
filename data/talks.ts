        How do Web Crypto APIs differ from the Crypto module in Node.js?

        In this talk I will be deep-diving into the world of Web Crypto APIs, starting from key generation, various encryption algorithms, implementation techniques, and more. The session will include live demos, coding examples, and a fun side project that I created as a result of learning about the Web Crypto APIs. Let’s set out on a collaborative learning adventure and delve into the functionalities of Web Crypto APIs.`,

Turns out, spec writers and browser makers both are working hard to find common JS patterns and implementing them in CSS and HTML. Things like accordions, auto-suggest, smooth scrolling, dialogs are all available without JS. Looking a little ahead, things like parallax scrolling, styleable selects and component-dependent styling are expected to make their CSS-debut as well.

In this talk I go through common patterns, explain how they can be implemented in CSS and HTML, how that's better and what accessibility implications they have, both for features available today and feature available soon™️.`,

In my talk, I aim to introduce a fresh approach for generating and storing tokens known as DPoP (Demonstrating Proof of Possession). DPoP is an emerging standard that extends the current OAuth 2.0 framework, offering an innovative solution to the challenges faced by web developers in token management. This approach is a potential game changer, that can significantly elevate the security of prevalent authentication and authorization mechanisms on the web today.
