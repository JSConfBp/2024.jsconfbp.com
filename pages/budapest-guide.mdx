  <h1>Budapest Guide</h1>
</Divider>

Often described as the "Little Paris of Middle Europe", Budapest is famous not only for the monuments
reflecting its own 1,000-year-old culture, but also for the relics of others who settled here before that.
The capital has two sides, Buda and Pest, stretching along the banks of the Danube, representing two different
characters of the city.

Buda and its historic castle district offer medieval streets, houses, thermal baths, museums, even caves and
Roman ruins. The dynamic Pest side boasts the largest parliament building in Europe, riverside promenades,
flea markets, bookstores, café houses and the ruin-pubs. Budapest was recently listed within the top 6 cities
in Europe, best suited for startups.

Chain Bridge you may explore the Castle Hill on the Buda side (use one of the first funiculars in Europe to
go up or to get down), then get back to Pest and see the Vörösmarty Square. Here you will also find Váci street,
the old shopping street of Budapest.

## Accomodation around the venue

Our venue is in the heart of the city, near Astoria, the Great Synagogue at Dohány street, and the party
quarters in Budapest. The following districts around are a relatively short distance away:

- Erzsébetváros
- Palotanegyed
- Lipótváros

## Airport Shuttle

The Liszt Ferenc International Airport is at the outskirts of Budapest. There is a public transport line 100E to connect the Liszt Ferenc Airport with the Deak Square in the center of the city, from where you can reach any part of the city by public transport.

The "Airport shuttle bus single ticket" costs 900 HUF (around 2.9 EUR), and is accepted only on this bus.

Other buses and public transport to get to and from the airport

Or you can take a taxi, at the dedicated taxi stations at 2A and 2B terminals, operated by FoTaxi.
You have to tell the operators your destination, they will call you a car, and give a good estimate on the
fare, which is usually around 19 EUR to the city center.

## Transportation

The Budapest public transportation company (BKK) has several options to visitors who stay for a few days.
You can buy a regular 7 day travel card which costs around 16 EUR, or there is the Budapest Card for 72 hours,
which is 31 EUR, but gives several discounts on entry fees to baths, museums, and can be bought online.

We recommend to use the BudapestGO mobile app to use the public transportation at Budapest as a visitor.
You can purchase tickets and use the map to plan your travel around the city.
Get the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/bkk-fut%C3%A1r/id916193835?l=hu) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.webvalto.bkkfutar&showAllReviews=true)

Uber was banned from the city, there are alternatives by taxi companies,
like [FoTaxi](https://fotaxi.hu/en/) and [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/) _(formerly Taxify)_.

## Useful Places around the venue

We've created a map, with useful places like shops, ATMs, pharmacies and places for lunch/breakfast and pubs.
This map will be constantly updated to be used for further events in Budapest.

## Is Budapest an LGBTQ+ welcoming city?

You probably saw our message in the footer of this very website that **JSConf Budapest welcomes everybody,** and
you’ve probably already read our [Code of Conduct](https://jsconfbp.com/code-of-conduct). Yet, you might still
be hesitant. You might not know how safe you’ll be in our city, or what options you’ll have as a member of the
LGBTQ+ community for activities outside the conference. How accepting is Budapest? What are the best, most
inclusive bars out there? We hope we can help you out a little bit. We got in touch with Hungary’s largest and
oldest LGBTQI organization, [Háttér Society](http://en.hatter.hu/), to compile the following
**list of information and tips for getting around in Budapest for members of the LGBTQ+ community.**

First of all, we do take our Code of Conduct very seriously. We’ll do our best to make sure you’ll have the
grandest old time during our conference. Outside of the conference, we can only give you some general advice,
and, given our already challenging responsibilities during the event, we’re afraid we cannot provide any
further assistance to ensure your safety and well-being in our city. With that out of the way, let’s see what
Budapest has to offer.

The good news is, [Budapest is one of the 50 places in the world listed by TripAdvisor as an LGBTQ+ welcoming city](https://www.tripadvisor.com/blog/lgbtq/). **Homophobic and transphobic hate crime is punishable by Hungarian law,** as is every kind of crime committed against a member of a community. **Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is also strictly forbidden.** If you ever encounter a rare case of discriminatory attitude or anything like this - for example, someone refuses to serve you at a bar or a restaurant - you are encouraged to get legal help. Feel free to contact Háttér Society at [legalaid@hatter.hu](mailto:legalaid@hatter.hu).

The reality is, depending on the situation, you might get some looks or, worst-case scenario, get yelled at by
someone. Our friends at Háttér Society told us that based on some real-world experience, depending on how
visibly you present as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, these things can happen on some occasions.
But it’s rare to have things escalate to the point of physical harm. We know that most of you will not speak
or understand Hungarian, and not being able to defend yourselves is disheartening. But, in any case,
however sad it makes us to write this, it’s easier to get out of the situation as fast as you can and not
let things spoil your otherwise memorable time in Budapest.

## What are my options for LGBTQ+ friendly activities in Budapest?

The LGBTQ website [Pink Budapest has a great list summing up the nightlife in Budapest](https://pinkbudapest.com/lgbtq-in-budapest), claiming that this city has the best gay scene in Central Europe. There are regular events taking place around downtown that are moving from venue to venue, so be sure to check out [QCalendar](https://www.qalendar.hu/).
